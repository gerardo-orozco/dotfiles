# Sublime Text Custom settings

These are files specific to customize usage for Sublime Text 3. Here I include
general, package and syntax-specific settings files.

The general settings [Preferences.sublime-settings](./Preferences.sublime-settings)
are overridden by package and syntax-specific settings.

[Package Control.sublime-settings](./Package Control.sublime-settings)
contains all the plugins that Sublime Text should install the first time it runs.
